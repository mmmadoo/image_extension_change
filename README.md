# image_extension_change

This code was uploaded to Render to create a web application.
"image_extension_change"ã€€can change the file extension and name of the photo file.

#Features

You can change the extension and name of the specified photo file. You can also download the changed file from there.
A delete function has also been implemented in case you make a mistake when changing the extension or the name after changing it.

#Requirement

Python 3.12.4
Flask 3.1.0
pillow 11.2.1
urllib3 2.2.3

#Note

"Files" is a folder for storing files downloaded by render. The .gitkeep file inside is meaningless, so it is not uploaded as a file in app.py.
Since "requirements.txt" is also required for installing packages with render, you do not need to create it for personal use.
This is an application I implemented mainly for a friend of mine, so it is limited to only the necessary extensions.
I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.
